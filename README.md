### Salient Elements
- Strings are not hard coded
- Styles were used to format all ImageViews and TextViews
- A bit of photoshop helped to create the nice gradient effect. 
- Ripple Animation on clicking phone number.

While it is true that I have written relatively more complicated apps, but I had never much paid attention to its appearance
and best coding practices. Using @styles and changing the ActionBar background to a drawable was done for the first time.
